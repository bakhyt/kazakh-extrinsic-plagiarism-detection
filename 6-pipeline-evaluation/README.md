# Pipeline Evaluation

This folder provides an evaluation of the plagiarism detection pipeline (**SimHash + Kazakh RoBERTa**) on a large-scale dataset consisting of approximately **1,000 Kazakh documents**. 

The evaluation aims to demonstrate the pipeline‚Äôs effectiveness, scalability, and real-world applicability.

## Evaluation Objectives:

- Assess the pipeline's ability to accurately identify plagiarised text segments within a large corpus.
- Evaluate the combined effectiveness of SimHash candidate filtering followed by RoBERTa-based classification.
- Present comprehensive metrics to quantify pipeline performance:
  - **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score**

## Notebook:

- [`6-pipeline-evaluation.ipynb`](6-pipeline-evaluation.ipynb):
  - Detailed instructions, code for reproducing the pipeline evaluation, and the results analysis.

## Key Outcomes:

- Performance metrics highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the pipeline.
- Practical insights into the pipeline‚Äôs scalability and computational efficiency in realistic scenarios.
