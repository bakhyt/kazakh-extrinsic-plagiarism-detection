# Plagiarism Detection Pipeline

This folder contains the implementation of a **two-step plagiarism detection pipeline** specifically developed for the Kazakh language. The pipeline leverages a hybrid approach combining:

- **SimHash**: For efficiently identifying candidate plagiarism cases among large document collections.
- **Fine-tuned the trained model**: For precise classification of suspicious text pairs as plagiarised or non-plagiarised.

## Notebook:

- [`5-plagiarism-detection-pipeline.ipynb`](5-plagiarism-detection-pipeline.ipynb):
  - Step-by-step code demonstrating the pipeline implementation, explanations of each stage, and practical usage examples.
