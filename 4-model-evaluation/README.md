# Model Evaluation

This folder assesses the performance of trained models on both Kazakh and English test datasets, providing benchmark results that inform model selection. The evaluation covers the following models:

- **Kazakh Models:**  
  XLM-RoBERTa (Large/Base), DistilBERT, MiniLM, SBERT, KazakhBERTmulti
- **English Models:**  
  XLM-RoBERTa (Large/Base), DistilBERT, MiniLM, SBERT

For each model, we evaluate suspicious and source text pairs from its corresponding test dataset‚Äîeither the Kazakh or English version (available in the 2-dataset folder)‚Äîto determine whether each pair is plagiarized (label=1) or not (label=0). We measure performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score, which offer a comprehensive view of each model's effectiveness. These benchmark results are essential for selecting the optimal model for integration into the Kazakh extrinsic plagiarism detection pipeline.
