# Kazakh Extrinsic Plagiarism Detection

This project develops **extrinsic plagiarism detection methods** tailored specifically for the Kazakh language. We created a comprehensive labeled dataset, trained and tested machine learning model (XLM-RoBERTa), and evaluated their effectiveness.

## Project Goals:

- Develop the first publicly available Kazakh extrinsic plagiarism detection dataset.
- Train and test models specifically for the Kazakh language.
- Establish baseline results and comparison with English-language models.

## Project Structure:

- [`1-dataset-preparation`](1-dataset-preparation): Code and methodology for dataset preparation.
- [`2-dataset`](2-dataset): Ready-to-use training and testing datasets.
- [`3-model-training`](3-model-training): Code and details for model training.
- [`4-model-evaluation`](4-model-evaluation): Model evaluation and metric results.
