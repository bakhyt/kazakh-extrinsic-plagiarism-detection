# Kazakh Extrinsic Plagiarism Detection

This repository provides datasets, code, and methods specifically designed for extrinsic plagiarism detection in the Kazakh language. The project aims to identify plagiarism by comparing suspicious texts against a collection of potential source texts using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, particularly transformer-based models and Simhash algorithms.

- Detailed explanations, scripts, and a Jupyter notebook describing how the original PAN plagiarism corpus was processed and adapted into a Kazakh dataset.
- Automatic translation from English to Kazakh using the Google Translate API.
- Labeling and alignment of text pairs.

### [2. Dataset](2-dataset)
- Cleaned, balanced, and labeled datasets ready for training and evaluating plagiarism detection models.
- Includes training and testing datasets.

### [3. Model Training](3-model-training)
- Scripts, notebooks, and detailed steps used for training XLM-RoBERTa models on the Kazakh plagiarism detection dataset.
- Provides guidance on best practices and optimization strategies.

### [4. Model Evaluation](4-model-evaluation)
- Comprehensive benchmarking and evaluation of trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Comparison and analysis of model performance.

### [5. Plagiarism Detection Pipeline](5-plagiarism-detection-pipeline)
- Implementation of a practical plagiarism detection pipeline combining the **Simhash algorithm** with a fine-tuned **XLM-RoBERTa** model.
- Pipeline designed for efficient plagiarism detection in large-scale document collections.

### [6. Pipeline Evaluation](6-pipeline-evaluation)
