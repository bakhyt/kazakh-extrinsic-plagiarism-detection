# Kazakh Extrinsic Plagiarism Detection

This repository offers a comprehensive solution for extrinsic plagiarism detection in the Kazakh language. It includes datasets, code, and methodologies that leverage advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques‚Äîsuch as transformer-based models and algorithms‚Äîto compare suspicious texts against a repository of potential source texts.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

### [1. Dataset Preparation](1-dataset-preparation)
- Detailed scripts, explanations, and a Jupyter notebook outlining the process of converting the original PAN plagiarism corpus into a Kazakh dataset.
- Automated translation of English texts to Kazakh using the Google Translate API.
- Precise alignment and labeling of text pairs.

### [2. Dataset](2-dataset)
- Cleaned, balanced, and labeled datasets prepared for training and evaluation.
- Separate files for training and testing datasets.

### [3. Model Training](3-model-training)
- Scripts, notebooks, and detailed instructions for training transformer models on the Kazakh plagiarism detection dataset.
- Optimized hyperparameters and training configurations for each model architecture.

### [4. Model Evaluation](4-model-evaluation)
- Comprehensive benchmarking of trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Comparative analysis to determine the best-performing model for the Kazakh extrinsic plagiarism detection pipeline.

### [5. Plagiarism Detection Pipeline](5-plagiarism-detection-pipeline)
- Implementation of a practical, scalable plagiarism detection pipeline based on the trained transformer models.
- Designed for efficient detection in large-scale document collections.

### [6. Pipeline Evaluation](6-pipeline-evaluation)
- End-to-end evaluation of the plagiarism detection pipeline, demonstrating its effectiveness and real-world applicability.

## üéØ Objectives
- Develop robust NLP-based methods specifically tailored for detecting extrinsic plagiarism in Kazakh.
- Provide high-quality, openly available datasets to support the Kazakh NLP research community.
- Benchmark state-of-the-art transformer models for improved accuracy in plagiarism detection.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion and Future Work
