# Kazakh Extrinsic Plagiarism Detection

This repository provides a comprehensive framework, including datasets, models, and a robust pipeline for **extrinsic plagiarism detection specifically tailored for the Kazakh language**. The primary objective is to detect plagiarism by comparing suspicious documents against source documents, leveraging state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly transformer-based models.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

### 1. [Dataset Preparation](1-dataset-preparation)
- Detailed methods, scripts, and notebooks to create and preprocess the Kazakh plagiarism detection dataset from the PAN Plagiarism Detection Corpus.
- Extraction and alignment of plagiarized English text pairs and their translation into Kazakh.

### 2. [Dataset](2-dataset)
- Prepared, cleaned, labeled, balanced, and shuffled training and testing datasets suitable for NLP model training and evaluation.

### 3. [Model Training](3-model-training)
- Training scripts and Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the fine-tuning of transformer models, particularly **XLM-RoBERTa Large**, optimized for detecting plagiarism in Kazakh texts.

### 4. [Model Evaluation](4-model-evaluation)
- Evaluation scripts, benchmarking results, and metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) showcasing model effectiveness.

### 5. [Plagiarism Detection Pipeline](5-plagiarism-detection-pipeline)
- An efficient hybrid detection system combining **SimHash** for rapid candidate retrieval and the trained **XLM-RoBERTa** model for accurate plagiarism classification.

### 6. [Pipeline Evaluation](6-pipeline-evaluation)
- Comprehensive evaluation of the developed pipeline on a large-scale dataset (~1000 documents), emphasizing real-world applicability, efficiency, and accuracy.
