# Kazakh Extrinsic Plagiarism Detection

This repository provides datasets, code, and methods specifically designed for extrinsic plagiarism detection in the Kazakh language. The project aims to identify plagiarism by comparing suspicious texts against a collection of potential source texts using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, particularly transformer-based models and Simhash algorithms.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

### [1. Dataset Preparation](1-dataset-preparation)
- Detailed explanations, scripts, and a Jupyter notebook describing how the original PAN plagiarism corpus was processed and adapted into a Kazakh dataset.
- Automatic translation from English to Kazakh using the Google Translate API.
- Labeling and alignment of text pairs.

### [2. Dataset](2-dataset)
- Cleaned, balanced, and labeled datasets ready for training and evaluating plagiarism detection models.
- Includes training and testing datasets.

### [3. Model Training](3-model-training)
- Scripts, notebooks, and detailed steps used for training transformer models on the Kazakh plagiarism detection dataset.
- Optimized hyperparameters for each architecture

### [4. Model Evaluation](4-model-evaluation)
- Comprehensive benchmarking and evaluation of trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Comparison and analysis of model performance.

### [5. Plagiarism Detection Pipeline](5-plagiarism-detection-pipeline)
- Implementation of a practical plagiarism detection pipeline of the trained transformer model.
- Pipeline designed for efficient plagiarism detection in large-scale document collections.

### [6. Pipeline Evaluation](6-pipeline-evaluation)
- Evaluation of the plagiarism detection pipeline.


## üéØ Objectives
- Develop robust NLP-based plagiarism detection methods tailored for Kazakh.
- Provide high-quality datasets for the Kazakh NLP research community.
- Benchmark state-of-the-art transformer models for Kazakh extrinsic plagiarism detection.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion and Future Work

In this project, we successfully created a robust pipeline for detecting extrinsic plagiarism in Kazakh texts by:

- **Preparing and labeling a Kazakh dataset**.
- **Training and evaluating** transformer-based NLP models, achieving strong performance metrics.
- Developing a **plagiarism detection pipeline** to efficiently identify plagiarism at scale.

### üöÄ Future Directions:
- Improve detection accuracy with fine-tuning strategies and advanced transformer architectures.
- Explore multilingual and cross-lingual plagiarism detection.
- Integrate this plagiarism detection pipeline into practical applications, such as educational platforms and publishing industry solutions.
